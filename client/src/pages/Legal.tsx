      <h2>1. General Information</h2>
      <p>
        This Legal Disclaimer ("Disclaimer") applies to the Chillar Club platform, including all services, content, and functions available through our website and applications (collectively referred to as the "Platform"). By accessing or using our Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Disclaimer.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Not a Gambling Service</h2>
      <p>
        Chillar Club is a subscription-based reward platform. Our service operates as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users pay a fixed subscription fee (â‚¹1 per day)</li>
        <li>All active subscribers are automatically entered into weekly draws</li>
        <li>Winners are randomly selected to receive digital rewards</li>
        <li>No additional purchase or payment is required to participate in draws beyond the subscription fee</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our platform is <strong>not a gambling service</strong> for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subscribers pay a fixed fee regardless of outcome</li>
        <li>There is no possibility of winning money or monetary equivalents</li>
        <li>All rewards are digital items with no cash value</li>
        <li>Subscribers receive ongoing platform access and features in exchange for their subscription, regardless of whether they win rewards</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Age Restrictions and Compliance</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h2>4. No Guarantee of Rewards</h2>
      <p>
        While we conduct regular draws to distribute rewards to our subscribers, we do not guarantee that any particular subscriber will win a reward. The chance of winning depends on the number of active subscribers at the time of each draw. Winners are selected through a fair and random process, but individual results may vary.
